# Documentation _for those who Dislike Documentation_

**Tools Used:**
- Git (_optional_)
- GitHub
- GitBook
- Markdown ([cheatsheet](markdown-cheatsheet.pdf))

**Background:**
[GitBook](http://gitbook.com) provides an easy-to-use platform to develop professional documentation. GitBook is closely integrated with [GitHub](http://www.github.com) which allows version control of documentation. Lastly, all documents are written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), a simple mark-up language that can be learned in a few minutes of practice.

**Intended Audience:**
The contents of the template repository is designed for individuals and organizations in the _research computing field_. However, with modification, the template could be used my nearly anyone.

Let's get started!

## GitHub and GitBook Account Setup

_If you do not already have one, please create an account at [Github](https://github.com/). Do the same at [GitBook](http://www.gitbook.com) (you may create an account at GitBook using your GitHub credentials)._

<br>

#### GitHub Setup

Once you have created an account at GitHub, you can "fork" my template repository so that a copy of it will appear as a repository that belongs to you.

- Navigate to the template repository at https://github.com/wendikristine/documentation-template
- On the top right of the screen, click the `Fork` button, then choose the organization or location where you would like the repository to be forked.

After the repository has been forked, you are ready to move to the GitBook setup.

#### GitBook Setup
- First, you will be asked to create a new organization.

- Name your organization, perhaps using the name of the department or employer name. Click `Next` to choose a URL for the organization. Click `Next` again to name the project. Each organization may have several projects. Lastly, choose your level of privacy: Public, Unlisted, or Public. Finalize your choices and continue.

- You could stop here and use the GitBook editor to create content. However, to enable version control by linking your GitBook project to a GitHub repository, click on the `···` that is located on the upper-right corner of the Organization box, as shown below. Then click `Integrations`.

- On the new screen that appears, click `GitHub` &rarr; `Link your GitHub Repository`. If you have used your GitHub credentials to login to GitBook, this is very simple. If not, you will need to enter your GitHub credentials when prompted. Follow the [GitBook Documentation](https://docs.gitbook.com/integrations/github) for details about connecting a GitHub repository to your GitBook organization. **Be sure to use the forked repository as the link to GitBook**.

- Choose which branch(es) to synchronize (usually just master) and where you would like to perform documentation editing (GitHub or GitBook).

- Once the content is synchronized, click the `Go live` button to view your new documentation site!
